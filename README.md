## Overview
<!-- TODO: Update overview -->

This project contains a PowerApp, which is the main entry point for the application. Backend functionality is provided through a Go application, which handles associations with GitHub, and events (including leavers.)

Microsoft has an excellent [GitHub management portal](https://github.com/microsoft/opensource-portal) to allow for self-service at scale - but this provides significantly more functionality than some organizations require.

It's recommended to call the leaving API as part of your JML process when users leave the organisation, but a Power Automate example is provided as an alternative (this is significantly less performant.)

This repository allows for basic self-service and automation of common workflows using PowerApps for:
- Automatically
  - Ensuring all users on GitHub are active employees
  - Checking each repository has an active business sponsor
  - Checking each repository has mandatory code scans
- Self-service
  - Request to join the GitHub organization
  - Request a new repository, and tracking of the ticket through approvals
  - Request permission for a code contribution of <50 lines

## Licensing
